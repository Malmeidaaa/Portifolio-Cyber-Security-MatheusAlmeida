                <h2>1. The Context of Technology and Sports (#TrendingCyber)</h2>
                <p>Technology and sports have a long history, but their integration has deepened drastically.
                    Originally, technology was introduced clandestinely to gain a competitive advantage, such as the use
                    of a radio receiver by the NFL's Cleveland Browns in 1956, which was subsequently banned by the
                    league commissioner until 1994.</p>
                <p>Currently, sports leagues collect huge volumes of real-time data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>NFL:</strong> Uses up to 30 ultra-wideband (UWB) receivers and radio frequency
                        identification (RFID) tags on players, referees, and even the ball, collecting over 200 new data
                        points on every play.</li>
                    <li><strong>FIFA (2022 World Cup):</strong> Used 12 cameras with four-dimensional optical tracking,
                        monitoring 29 points on players' bodies, assisting referees with offside calls and revealing
                        valuable performance analytics.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Data analytics is changing the game itself (e.g., in baseball, home runs are prioritized over bunts,
                    and in football, the shotgun formation is preferred over plays under center).</p>
                <p><strong>Privacy:</strong> This raises serious questions about athlete data privacy, including the use
                    of data analytics to predict injuries in contract negotiations and whether nutrition and sleep data
                    should be shared with bettors.</p>

                <h2>2. Oversight and Administration</h2>
                <p>Information security is divided into <strong>Oversight</strong> and <strong>Operations</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Oversight:</strong> The review and monitoring of processes, policies, plans, programs,
                        or projects, watching them "from above" ("over"). The goal is to ensure actions achieve expected
                        results, comply with policies, laws, and ethical standards, and represent good value for money.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Operations:</strong> The opposite of oversight, being the daily work "in the trenches"
                        of configuring equipment, applying controls, and reacting to cyber incidents.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.1. Governance</h3>
                <p>Governance refers to the structures, systems, and practices an organization implements to assign,
                    oversee, and report.</p>
                <p>The three key activities are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Assign:</strong> Decision-making responsibilities and setting strategic direction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oversee:</strong> Monitoring service delivery, policy/plan implementation, and risk
                        mitigation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Report:</strong> Reporting performance to drive continuous improvement and corrective
                        actions (monitoring and review).</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>2.2. Compliance</h3>
                <p>Compliance is the process of ensuring an organization adheres to laws and regulations related to
                    information security and user data privacy.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key Regulations:</strong> GDPR (EU), PCI DSS (Payments), HIPAA (US Health).</li>
                    <li><strong>Importance ("Carrot and Stick"):</strong> Provides "best practices" but imposes severe
                        penalties (fines, sanctions, loss of license).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Compliance Monitoring</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Internal Monitoring:</strong> Performed by the organization itself (dedicated team +
                        automation). Generates internal reports.</li>
                    <li><strong>External Monitoring:</strong> Performed by third parties (audit). Generates official
                        attestation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Data Privacy</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Explicit Collection:</strong> User provides data for valid need.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hidden Collection:</strong> Secret tracking (trackers in apps and IoT).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Legal Protections:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>EU (GDPR):</strong> Right to be forgotten (erase data in ~30 days).</li>
                    <li><strong>USA:</strong> No federal right to be forgotten; sector-specific regulations (HIPAA).

                <h2>3. Security Operations</h2>
                <p>Security work is performed in the <strong>SOC (Security Operations Center)</strong>. The modern SOC
                    uses automation, orchestration, threat hunting, and AI.</p>

                <h3>3.1. Automation</h3>
                <p>Necessary due to data volume. Generates faster and scalable protection.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Efficiency, baseline enforcement, scalability, staff retention (less
                        burnout).</li>
                    <li><strong>Risks:</strong> Complexity, cost, technical debt, single point of failure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> CI/CD, API Integration (iPaaS), Scripting, Guardrails (cloud),
                        Automated Provisioning.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.2. Orchestration (SOAR)</h3>
                <p>Unlike automation (single task), orchestration automates a complete <strong>workflow</strong>,
                    connecting multiple tools.</p>
                <p><strong>SOAR:</strong> Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response.</p>

                <h3>3.3. Threat Hunting</h3>
                <p><strong>Proactive</strong>, iterative, and human activity.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Premise:</strong> Assumes the network is <em>already infected</em>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Process:</strong> Hypothesis -> Investigation -> Action.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maturity:</strong> Level 1 (Initial) to Level 5 (Optimized/Continuous).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.4. Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>
                <p>Gained popularity with ChatGPT (2022).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Analytics:</strong> Fixed process, relies on humans.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI:</strong> Autonomous, iterative, dynamic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> Subset of AI. Learns from data (statistics) without
                        explicit programming.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Riscos (Adversarial AI):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Compromise algorithms.</li>

                        <p>Governance refers to the structures, systems, and practices an organization uses for
                            oversight and administration. Its three core activities are assigning decision-making
                            responsibilities and strategic direction; overseeing the implementation of policies, plans,
                            and risk mitigation; and reporting on performance to drive improvements.</p>

                        <p>A policy is a formal statement from a governing body that outlines specific requirements or
                            rules that must be met to achieve the organization's strategic objectives. A procedure
                            provides the detailed, mandatory, step-by-step instructions that an employee must follow to
                            implement and comply with a given policy.</p>

                        </summary>
                        <p>Compliance monitoring refers to the quality assurance tests organizations use to determine
                            how well their operations adhere to security laws, regulations, and standards. It can be
                            performed internally by a dedicated compliance team, often using automation tools to
                            generate reports. It can also be performed externally by a professional third party, which
                            examines the organization's protections and creates an official report or attestation.</p>

                        <summary>4. Explain the concept of threat hunting and its core assumption regarding the
                            network's security status.</summary>
                        <p>Threat hunting is a proactive and predominantly human-led activity to identify a cyber
                            invasion that has evaded existing security controls. Its core assumption is that the network
                            is already infected, meaning attackers are currently operating inside the network rather
                            than trying to enter from the outside.</p>

                        <p>Security automation involves setting a single security-related task to run on its own without
                            human intervention. Security orchestration is a broader concept that automates an entire
                            process or workflow by combining and coordinating multiple individual automated tasks across
                            different platforms, including hardware, software, and services.</p>

                            machine learning (ML).</summary>
                        <p>Data analytics is the process of examining large data sets to draw conclusions, where
                            researchers manually create algorithms to find patterns. AI is a subset of data analytics
                            that is autonomous, using the algorithms to create its own predictive models. ML is a
                            further subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to "learn" from data and progressively
                            improve its performance without being explicitly reprogrammed.</p>

                        <p>An acceptable-use policy is a formal written statement that defines the actions users are
                            permitted to perform while accessing an organization's systems and networking equipment. The
                            policy's audience is not limited to employees but also includes vendors, contractors, and
                            visitors, each of whom may have different privileges.</p>

                        <p>Implementing security automation introduces several risks, including increased complexity in
                            managing interconnected appliances and higher initial and ongoing support costs. Other risks
                            include creating technical debt if problems are not addressed immediately and the potential
                            for a single point of failure if there is an over-reliance on the automated system.</p>

                        <p>The "right to be forgotten" is a fundamental principle of EU data protection that gives data
                            subjects (any living individual whose data is collected) the legal right to have their
                            private data erased by a data controller without undue delay, which is typically interpreted
                            to be about 30 days.</p>

                            be used?</summary>
                        <p>Adversarial artificial intelligence refers to threat actors attacking AI systems or using AI
                            for malicious purposes. One example is when attackers taint the training data used by a
                            machine learning system, causing it to produce false negatives and effectively cloak the
                            attackers' malicious activities from detection. Another example is using AI to develop
                            mutating malware that can change its structure to evade signature-based defenses.</p>
