                <h2>My Professional Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, I am Matheus Almeida. I am a technology professional passionate about innovation and driven
                    by the challenge of protecting critical digital infrastructures. With a solid academic foundation
                    built in both Brazil and the United States, I am on a strategic career transition journey, migrating
                    from a successful trajectory in corporate event management to the dynamic world of
                    <strong>Cybersecurity. </strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal is clear: to join teams that value data-driven decisions and information security, applying
                    my technical knowledge in threat detection and risk mitigation to contribute to organizational
                    success in the North American market. I am proactive, dedicated, and possess an insatiable interest
                    in continuous learning and professional growth.

                <h2>From Event Manager to Cyber Defender: A Journey of Evolution</h2>
                <p>
                    My professional trajectory is not linear, and I consider this my greatest strategic differentiator.
                    For over seven years, I served as founder and executive of <em>Green Events and Company</em>. In
                    this position, I didn't just manage events; I managed crises, complex logistics, rigorous budgets,
                    and multidisciplinary teams. The responsibility of leading innovation and technology projects for
                    major trade fairs and congresses taught me to anticipate problems before they occurred — a skill I
                    now directly transpose to cybersecurity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In event management, "security" involved physical integrity and operational success. Today, I
                    redirect this mindset of <strong>Risk Management and Compliance</strong> to the digital environment.
                    The ability to negotiate with suppliers, analyze technical feasibility, and lead under pressure are
                    soft skills I carry with me that make me a more complete analyst, capable of communicating complex
                    technical risks clearly to stakeholders at all levels.
                </p>

            <section id="compromisso-tech" class="card">
                <h2>Technical Engagement and Cybersecurity Education</h2>
                <p>
                    To consolidate my transition, I dove deep into technical qualification. Currently, I am pursuing my
                    <em>Associate Degree</em> in Cybersecurity at <strong>McFatter Technical College</strong> in the
                    USA. This hands-on program has been fundamental in sharpening my skills in threat identification,
                    protection against hackers, and network security, covering everything from intrusion detection to
                    penetration testing and cryptography.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am not content with just the classroom. I sought validation through the most respected
                    certifications in the market. As a <strong>Cisco Certified Junior Cybersecurity Analyst</strong>, I
                    mastered fundamental principles such as endpoint security, vulnerability assessment, and incident
                    response. Additionally, the <strong>Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate</strong> expanded
                    my horizon on security frameworks, industrial controls, and essential regulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am constantly challenging myself with new goals. Currently, I am in the process of obtaining
                    <strong>CompTIA Security+</strong> and <strong>CompTIA CySA+</strong> certifications, demonstrating
                    my unwavering commitment to staying ahead of emerging threats.

                <h2>Academic and Technological Foundation</h2>
                <p>
                    My passion for technology was formalized in Brazil at the <strong>Federal University of ABC
                        (UFABC)</strong>, where I pursued a Bachelor's in Science and Technology with a focus on
                    Computer Science. I graduated with a robust foundation in network architecture, software
                    development, and information security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was at the university that I developed my analytical skills through advanced mathematics, logic,
                    and algorithms. I deepened my knowledge in <strong>Python</strong> programming to create innovative
                    solutions and studied database management and Cloud Computing, preparing myself for modern and
                    scalable technological environments.

                <h2>Multidisciplinary Professional Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    My practical experience reflects my versatility. Recently, I assumed the position of <strong>Entry
                        Level Data Analyst at Minerva Foods USA</strong>, where I oversee inventory procedures, develop
                    supply chain standards, and collaborate directly with IT professionals to implement effective
                    systems, always tracking vital KPIs for the business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Previously, at <strong>Accenture</strong>, I worked as both a Support Technician and a Financial
                    Analyst. These experiences gave me a 360º view of the corporate environment: from "shop floor"
                    technical support, resolving hardware and software incidents and maintaining the operability of
                    Windows systems and Active Directory, to rigorous financial analysis of accounts receivable and bank
                    reconciliation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also value my experience as a Substitute Teacher at <em>Kelly Education</em>, where I refined my
                    communication, adaptability, and group management skills in multicultural environments — essential
                    skills for Security Awareness training.

                    I am prepared to apply my acquired knowledge and contribute to the innovation and technological
                    security of your company. The combination of my executive experience in events with my rigorous
                    technical training in Cybersecurity allows me to see beyond the code: I see the impact of risk on
                    the business and the importance of people in the security equation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I seek an opportunity where I can protect assets, analyze critical data, and grow together with a
